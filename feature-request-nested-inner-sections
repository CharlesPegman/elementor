I use inner sections a lot to get accurate alignment in multi column sections. Sometimes I need to put 2 items next to each other (e.g. 2 buttons) in a column within an inner section.
But I can't nest another inner section - which seems like the obvious thng to do.
Can this feature be considered, please?
